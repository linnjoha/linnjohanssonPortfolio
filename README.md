I am a passionate developer student with a strong interest in web development and new technologies. I love building interactive web applications and constantly strive to improve my skills. This portfolio is a reflection of my work and growth in the field.

# Technologies Used
This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- React: For building the user interface.
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server.
- React Router: For client-side routing.
- Three.js: For creating 3D graphics and animations.

I chose these technologies because they provide a robust and efficient framework for building modern web applications, allowing for smooth navigation, fast loading times, and dynamic content.
