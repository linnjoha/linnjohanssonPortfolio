I am a passionate developer student with a strong interest in web development and new technologies. I love building interactive web applications and constantly strive to improve my skills. This portfolio is a reflection of my work and growth in the field.

# Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- React: For building the user interface.
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server.
- React Router: For client-side routing.
- Three.js: For creating 3D graphics and animations.
- CSS: For styling the application.

I chose these technologies because they provide a robust and efficient framework for building modern web applications, allowing for smooth navigation, fast loading times, and dynamic content.

# Features

- About Me: A section with information about my background, interests, and career goals.
- Projects: A showcase of my school projects, including descriptions and links.
- Contact Page: A form to get in touch with me.

# Additional Considerations

# Styling and Design

This portfolio utilizes modern CSS techniques to ensure a clean and responsive design. Media queries are used to adapt the layout for various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Performance

Vite ensures fast build times and hot module replacement, making development smoother and more efficient. Three.js is optimized for rendering 3D graphics, ensuring smooth performance even with complex models.
